EPFL - Introduction to natural language processing
CS-431 / 6 credits

Teacher(s): Bosselut Antoine, Chappelier Jean-Cédric, Rajman Martin

Language: English

Summary

The objective of this course is to present the main models, formalisms and algorithms necessary for the development of applications in the field of natural language information processing. The concepts introduced during the lectures will be applied during practical sessions.

Content

Several models and algorithms for automated textual data processing will be described: morpho-lexical level: n-gram and language models, spell checkers, ...; semantic level: models and formalisms for the representation of meaning, embedings, ...
Several application domains will be presented: Linguistic engineering, Information Retrieval,  Textual Data Analysis (automated document classification, visualization of textual data).
Keywords

Natural Language Processing; Computationnal Linguisitics; Part-of-Speech tagging

 

Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, the student must be able to:

Compose key NLP elements to develop higher level processing chains
Assess / Evaluate NLP based systems
Choose appropriate solutions for solving typical NLP subproblems (tokenizing, tagging, ...)
Describe the typical problems and processing layers in NLP
Analyze NLP problems to decompose them in adequate independant components
Teaching methods

Flipped classroom (reviews and supervised "hands-on" in class) ; practical work on computer

Expected student activities

attend lectures and practical sessions, answer quizzes.

Assessment methods

4 quiz during semester 16%, final exam 84%
